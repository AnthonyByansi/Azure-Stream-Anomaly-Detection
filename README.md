# Azure-Stream-Anomaly-Detection

![Architectural Diagram](path/to/architectural/diagram.png)

This repository contains a real-time anomaly detection system built using Azure Stream Analytics. The system monitors streaming data from various sources such as sensors, logs, IoT devices, etc., and applies machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in real-time. It leverages Azure services and custom code for data processing, feature engineering, model training, and alerting.

## Architecture Overview
